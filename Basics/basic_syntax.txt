1️. Header Files
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>


iostream → input/output (cin, cout)

cmath → math functions (sqrt, pow, etc.)

2️.Namespace
using namespace std;


Avoids writing std::cout, std::cin every time.

3️.Function
double calculateForce(double mass, double acceleration)


Demonstrates functions

Uses real mechanical formula: F = m × a

4. Data Types
int, float, double, char, bool


Used for:

counting

measurements

logical conditions

5️.Input & Output
cin >> acceleration;
cout << "Force is high";


Used to interact with the user.

6. Operators

Arithmetic: + - * /

Relational: > < ==

Assignment: =

Example:

double power = force * acceleration;

7️.Conditional Statements
if (force > 50) { ... } else { ... }


Used for decision making in engineering logic.

8️. Loops

for loop → fixed repetition

while loop → condition-based repetition

Very important for simulations and iterations.

9️. Arrays
double stresses[3];


Stores multiple values (e.g., stress at different points).

🔟 Pointers
double* ptr = &force;


Used for:

memory access

performance

advanced engineering software

1️1. Math Functions
sqrt(force);


Useful for formulas and calculations.

1️2. main() Function
int main() { ... return 0; }


Program execution always starts here.

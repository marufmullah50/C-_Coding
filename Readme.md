# Mechanical Engineering Projects in C++

## About
This repository contains my learning and practice work where I use **C++ programming** to solve **basic to advanced mechanical engineering problems**.

I start from **C++ fundamentals** and gradually build programs that model **real-world mechanical systems** such as machines, mechanisms, and engineering calculations.

---

## Purpose
- Learn C++ step by step
- Apply programming to mechanical engineering concepts
- Solve real-world engineering problems through code
- Build a strong foundation in computational engineering

---

## What I Will Do Here
- Write basic C++ programs
- Implement mechanical formulas in code
- Simulate simple mechanical systems
- Create small engineering projects

---

## Topics Covered
- C++ basics
- Mechanics and machines
- Engineering calculations
- Simple simulations

---

## Status
This repository is a **work in progress** and will be updated as I learn and build more projects.
